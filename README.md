# openshift-cplus-sample
This repo contains samples to test the Openshift s2i-cpus builder image. There are samples to build
using CMake, make and g++ strategies.  For the g++ option the .s2i/bin/assemble file determines the build step.  For CMake a CMakeList.txt file is used to create build.  For make the Makefile is used to perform the build.
